Shell scripts for quickly building different versions of several projects.

- Edit `env.sh` before building.

- Not trying to be foolproof.

	Previously experience with the target project and some shell scripting is
	expected.

- Scripts are executed with `/bin/sh -e`.
- Try to be reentrant.
- Use abs path in scripts.
